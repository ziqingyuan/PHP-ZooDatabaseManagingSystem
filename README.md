# PHP-ZooDatabaseManagingSystem

## Project Description

The conservation of wild animals and their worsening territories is a major concern these days. While it’s difficult to rapidly recover the damaged environment, zoo helps build and provide nice living areas for those animals and prevents species extinction. This inspired our group to design a Zoo management system database that helps stuffs to better manage the relationship among tourists, employees, animals, and animal shows. This system will also provide an overall graphical view of the zoo’s daily operations, from selling and booking different tickets to treating sick animals. In addition, this database can assist managers to have a clear image of the profit and customer flow during different periods of the year. The goal of this application is to help the zoo reduce time consumption, maintain organized running, and also cut paper usage wasting in order to better protect our environment throughout time.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
